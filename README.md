# Grey's Anatomy

### The American medical drama television program Grey's Anatomy made its midseason debut on ABC on March 27, 2005. The show centers on the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings as they advance to more experienced physicians while juggling their personal and professional ties. The phrase "Gray's Anatomy" is a reference to Henry Gray's well-known textbook of the same name, which was originally printed in London in 1858. The series' pilot was created by Shonda Rhimes, who also wrote for it up until 2015. The current showrunner is Krista Vernoff, who previously collaborated with Rhimes. Along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, Allan Heinberg, and Ellen Pompeo, Rhimes served as one of the executive producers.
